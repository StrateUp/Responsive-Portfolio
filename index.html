		<p>Hi! My name is Kayla and I am, right now,working very hard towards becoming a full stack developer. For the past 12 years I have devoted my degree in science to animal care. I have worked up from a tour guide to the senior-most level of Sea World's Aviculture team. I have raised, rescued, studied and cared for hundreds of birds including penguins, pelicans, puffins, and flamingos. The work is amazing but grueling. From zookeeping, I have learned a lot about how to solve 'interesting' problems and use thinking outside of the box in unpredictable situations. An acquired fish allergy has put a road block on all the growth I've made in my industry and has presented challenges to perform my job daily. I am ready to tackle a new project and can't wait to show you the skill I can apply. </p>
	<br>
		<p>I am born and raised in San Diego and hold a BS degree in Biology from UCI. I just got married this last June to a computer savvy husband who would love for me to help him with web development. We share our home in Del Mar with my 10 year old stepson, Max and out new pug puppy Sushi. We like going to the beach, hiking, running, eating, and laughing. </p>
